# Sorting-Visualizer
A sorting visualizer is a graphical tool that demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work. Users can choose algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort, and watch as data, represented as bars, is dynamically rearranged step-by-step. This project helps users understand sorting techniques visually.
